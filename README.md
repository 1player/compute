# DAS//compute

This repository is the forge vat into which *DAS//compute*, a second-generation computing system, is being grown.

It is based upon three main concepts:
- An architecture-independent language into which most of the system is written in.
- A message-passing, typed object model to represent the semantics of the system.
- An actor-based kernel running hosted on bare metal, or on top of an existing operating system, to run and exchange messages between actors.
